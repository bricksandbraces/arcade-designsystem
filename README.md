Awesome designsystem for the Bricks & Braces brand.

## How to use

At first, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn add @openbricksandbraces/designsystem
```

Then, import the styles from your main / application component (App.tsx on create-react-app):

```javascript
import React from 'react';

import "@openbricksandbraces/designsystem/lib/styles/dist/index.css"
import './App.css';
...
```

Instead of importing already processed styles you could also import

```javascript
import "@openbricksandbraces/designsystem/lib/styles/postcss/index.css";
```

for easy customisation reasons. Please note, that you need a postcss-loader for this. Make yourself common with the configuration by looking at [the designsystem repo](https://github.com/bricksandbraces/designsystem).

Last but not least, use a component from the library:

```javascript
...
import { Button, useInitialize } from "@openbricksandbraces/designsystem"

function App() {
  useInitialize();
  return (
   ...
        <Button label="Hello" />
   ...
  );
}
```

Aaaand you are done!

> **Note: use the useInitialize() hook to initialize mandatory listeners (for viewport height correction an such magical stuff ðŸª„).**
